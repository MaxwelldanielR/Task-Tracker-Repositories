🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this project to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/andressplaza/task-tracker.git
cd task-tracker


🖥️ Using the Task Tracker CLI
After setting up the environment, you can use the following commands to manage tasks.

Add a New Task
To add a new task, run:

php artisan app:add-task "Your task description"

Example:

php artisan app:add-task "Buy groceries"

This will create a new task with the description "Buy groceries" and store it in your SQLite database.

List All Tasks
To list all tasks, run:

php artisan app:list-tasks

Update a Task Status
To update the status of a task, use the following command:

php artisan app:update-status {task_id} {new_status}

Where {task_id} is the ID of the task and {new_status} can be one of the following: pending, in-progress, completed.

Example:

php artisan app:update-status 1 "completed"

This will update the task with ID 1 to the status "completed".

Update a Task Description
To update a task's description, use the following command:

php artisan app:update-task {task_id} {new_description}

Delete a Task
To delete a task, run:

php artisan app:delete-task {task_id}

🧪 Testing the Commands
To test that the commands are working correctly, you can run:

php artisan help app:add-task

This will show you how the command should be used.
